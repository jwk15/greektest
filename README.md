greektest
=========

Some code for Java classes for manipulating polytonic Greek strings. Respective Main methods demonstrate usage.

A couple of the classes are still pretty rough, though I forget which; I stopped actively working on this project more than a year ago.

CharInfo - the most developed class; gives information on the characters in a given Greek string (e.g., unaccented/accented/circumflex, iota-subsripted).

WordInfo - gives information on words in string, e.g., syllable divisions

Pronunciation - gives a phonetic, accentuated spelling of a string

DiacriticalTest & DiacriticalTest2 - I used these to report a bug with the way Eclipse handles UTF-8 (bug# 382257).

PrincipleParts - construct the six principal parts of a given regular Ï‰ verb. Work in progress.

ContractVowels - supposed to do vowell contraction. Work in progress.

GreekChar - work in progress

Accent - work in progress

PreNormalizer - work in progress
